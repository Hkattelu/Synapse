# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature simplifies the current heavyweight track management system by introducing 4 predefined tracks specifically tailored for educational content creation: Code, Visual, Narration, and "You". This change will make the first-time user experience more intuitive and streamlined, with upfront buttons for adding common educational content types like code snippets, videos, and assets. The simplified approach removes the complexity of manual track management while providing a structure that matches typical educational video workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an educator creating coding tutorials, I want predefined tracks that match my content workflow, so that I can quickly organize my materials without learning complex track management.

2. WHEN a user adds content THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest the appropriate track based on content type
3. WHEN a user drags code-related assets THEN the system SHALL default to placing them on the "Code" track
4. WHEN a user drags video assets THEN the system SHALL default to placing them on the "Visual" track for screen recordings or "You" track for talking head videos
5. WHEN a user drags audio assets THEN the system SHALL default to placing them on the "Narration" track
6. WHEN tracks are displayed THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual styling and colors for each track type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a first-time user, I want prominent buttons to add common educational content types, so that I can quickly start creating without exploring complex menus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the main interface THEN the system SHALL display prominent "Add Code", "Add Video", and "Add Assets" buttons
2. WHEN a user clicks "Add Code" THEN the system SHALL open a code editor interface and create a code timeline item on the Code track
3. WHEN a user clicks "Add Video" THEN the system SHALL open a file picker for video uploads and provide options for "Screen Recording" or "Talking Head"
4. WHEN a user clicks "Add Assets" THEN the system SHALL open a media library or file picker for images, graphics, and other visual assets
5. WHEN content is added via these buttons THEN the system SHALL automatically place items on the appropriate predefined track
6. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL use clear, descriptive icons and labels that match educational content workflows

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an educator, I want the "Code" track to be optimized for programming content, so that I can easily create code demonstrations and tutorials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is placed on the Code track THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting and code-specific styling by default
2. WHEN a user adds code content THEN the system SHALL provide language selection and theme options appropriate for educational content
3. WHEN code animations are applied THEN the system SHALL offer educational-focused presets like "typewriter", "line-by-line reveal", and "diff highlighting"
4. WHEN multiple code blocks exist on the Code track THEN the system SHALL provide easy switching between different code examples
5. WHEN code content is edited THEN the system SHALL maintain proper formatting and indentation
6. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL ensure code readability with appropriate font sizes and contrast for video content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an educator, I want the "Visual" track to handle screen recordings and visual aids, so that I can demonstrate software and concepts effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is placed on the Visual track THEN the system SHALL optimize for screen recording and demonstration content
2. WHEN screen recordings are added THEN the system SHALL provide cropping and focus tools for highlighting specific areas
3. WHEN images or graphics are added THEN the system SHALL provide positioning and animation options suitable for educational explanations
4. WHEN visual content overlaps with code THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side layout options
5. WHEN visual assets are animated THEN the system SHALL offer educational-focused animations like "highlight", "zoom focus", and "callout"
6. WHEN multiple visual elements exist THEN the system SHALL provide layering controls that maintain educational clarity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an educator, I want the "Narration" track to handle all audio content, so that I can easily manage voiceovers and background music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is placed on the Narration track THEN the system SHALL provide audio-specific controls and waveform visualization
2. WHEN audio is added THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust levels and provide noise reduction options
3. WHEN multiple audio clips exist THEN the system SHALL provide mixing controls and automatic ducking for background music
4. WHEN narration overlaps with other content THEN the system SHALL provide timing synchronization tools
5. WHEN audio is edited THEN the system SHALL provide basic editing tools like trim, fade, and volume adjustment
6. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL ensure audio quality is optimized for educational content delivery

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an educator, I want the "You" track for personal video content, so that I can add talking head segments and personal commentary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is placed on the You track THEN the system SHALL optimize for personal video content like talking head recordings
2. WHEN personal videos are added THEN the system SHALL provide background removal and replacement options
3. WHEN talking head content is configured THEN the system SHALL offer picture-in-picture positioning and sizing options
4. WHEN personal video overlaps with other content THEN the system SHALL provide compositing options that maintain focus on the educator
5. WHEN multiple personal video segments exist THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transition options between segments
6. WHEN personal content is styled THEN the system SHALL offer professional presentation templates and overlays

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user transitioning from the old system, I want my existing projects to work with the new simplified tracks, so that I don't lose my previous work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an existing project is opened THEN the system SHALL automatically migrate timeline items to appropriate predefined tracks based on content type
2. WHEN migration occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all timeline item properties and animations
3. WHEN track assignments are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide a migration dialog for user confirmation
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL save the updated project structure
5. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and preserve the original project data
6. WHEN migrated projects are used THEN the system SHALL maintain full compatibility with all existing features

### Requirement 8
