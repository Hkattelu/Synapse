# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the code editor with advanced visual capabilities to create more polished and professional code animations. The enhancement includes support for code diff animations, comprehensive theming system with code themes and background options (wallpapers and gradients), and transparent background export functionality. These improvements will significantly elevate the editor's visual appeal and professional output quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want different animation options for code diffs, so that I can create more engaging and visually appealing code demonstrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a code diff animation type THEN the system SHALL apply the chosen animation style to code changes
2. WHEN code is added THEN the system SHALL animate the new lines appearing with the selected animation effect
3. WHEN code is removed THEN the system SHALL animate the old lines disappearing with the selected animation effect
4. WHEN code is modified THEN the system SHALL animate the transition from old to new code with smooth visual effects
5. IF multiple animation types are available THEN the system SHALL provide a selection interface for choosing between them
6. WHEN an animation is playing THEN the system SHALL maintain proper timing and synchronization with the timeline

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer creating educational content, I want access to a comprehensive suite of code themes, so that I can match my code's visual style to my brand or presentation needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses theme selection THEN the system SHALL display a variety of popular code themes
2. WHEN a theme is selected THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting colors, background colors, and text styling consistently
3. WHEN previewing themes THEN the system SHALL show real-time preview of how the current code will look
4. IF a theme includes custom fonts THEN the system SHALL apply the appropriate font family and sizing
5. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected theme's visual fidelity in the output
6. WHEN switching themes THEN the system SHALL preserve all other editor settings and content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to set custom wallpapers and gradient backgrounds for my code editor, so that I can create more visually striking and branded content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects wallpaper mode THEN the system SHALL allow uploading and setting custom background images
2. WHEN a user selects gradient mode THEN the system SHALL provide gradient customization tools with color pickers
3. WHEN a background is applied THEN the system SHALL ensure code readability is maintained with proper contrast
4. WHEN using wallpapers THEN the system SHALL support common image formats (PNG, JPG, SVG)
5. IF background affects readability THEN the system SHALL provide opacity and overlay controls
6. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include the custom background in the final output

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a professional content creator, I want to export videos with transparent backgrounds, so that I can composite my code animations over other content in post-production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects transparent background export THEN the system SHALL render the video with alpha channel support
2. WHEN exporting with transparency THEN the system SHALL maintain code and UI element visibility while making backgrounds transparent
3. WHEN transparency is enabled THEN the system SHALL support appropriate video formats that preserve alpha channels
4. IF wallpapers or gradients are set THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose whether to include or exclude them in transparent exports
5. WHEN previewing transparent export THEN the system SHALL show a checkerboard pattern or similar indicator for transparent areas
6. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about transparency support in the selected format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive controls for managing all these visual enhancements, so that I can easily customize my editor appearance without complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing visual settings THEN the system SHALL provide a unified interface for themes, backgrounds, and animations
2. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL show real-time previews of the effects
3. WHEN settings are modified THEN the system SHALL save preferences for future sessions
4. IF settings conflict THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on resolution
5. WHEN resetting THEN the system SHALL allow users to return to default settings easily
6. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which visual enhancements will be included in the output
