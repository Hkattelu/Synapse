# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Synapse Studio is a web-based video creation tool designed for content creators who need to stitch video clips, integrate animated code snippets, and apply simple animation presets. The application functions as a Single Page Application (SPA) with a timeline-based editor powered by Remotion for programmatic video generation, built with React and TypeScript using Vite as the build tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to create and manage video projects through a web interface, so that I can produce professional videos without desktop software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard view with project management capabilities
2. WHEN a user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty timeline and media bin
3. WHEN a user opens an existing project THEN the system SHALL load the project's timeline, media assets, and configuration
4. IF a user has no projects THEN the system SHALL display an onboarding interface with project creation options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to import and manage media assets, so that I can organize my video content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads media files THEN the system SHALL store them in the media bin and validate file formats
2. WHEN a user drags media from the media bin to the timeline THEN the system SHALL create a new clip at the drop position
3. WHEN a user selects a media asset THEN the system SHALL display its properties and preview
4. IF an uploaded file is not a supported format THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the upload

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to arrange clips on a timeline interface, so that I can control the sequence and timing of my video content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a clip to the timeline THEN the system SHALL display it as a visual block with duration indicators
2. WHEN a user drags a clip on the timeline THEN the system SHALL update its position and timing in real-time
3. WHEN a user resizes a clip THEN the system SHALL adjust its duration while maintaining aspect ratio
4. WHEN a user selects a clip THEN the system SHALL highlight it and update the inspector panel
5. IF clips overlap THEN the system SHALL handle layering and provide visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to preview my video in real-time, so that I can see how my edits affect the final output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes changes to the timeline THEN the system SHALL update the preview automatically
2. WHEN a user plays the preview THEN the system SHALL render the video using Remotion with current timeline state
3. WHEN a user seeks to a specific time THEN the system SHALL display the frame at that timestamp
4. WHEN a user pauses the preview THEN the system SHALL maintain the current playback position

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to add animated code snippets to my videos, so that I can create educational programming content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a code sequence THEN the system SHALL provide a code editor interface
2. WHEN a user configures code animation THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting and animation presets
3. WHEN a code sequence plays THEN the system SHALL animate the code appearance with typing effects
4. IF code contains syntax errors THEN the system SHALL highlight errors while maintaining animation capability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to apply animation presets to my clips, so that I can enhance my videos with professional transitions and effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a clip THEN the system SHALL display available animation presets in the inspector
2. WHEN a user applies an animation preset THEN the system SHALL update the clip properties and preview
3. WHEN a user customizes animation parameters THEN the system SHALL provide real-time parameter adjustment
4. WHEN animations are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth playback performance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to inspect and modify clip properties, so that I can fine-tune individual elements of my video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a timeline item THEN the system SHALL display its properties in the inspector panel
2. WHEN a user modifies clip properties THEN the system SHALL update the timeline and preview immediately
3. WHEN a user changes animation settings THEN the system SHALL provide parameter sliders and input fields
4. IF invalid values are entered THEN the system SHALL validate input and display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the application to be responsive and performant, so that I can work efficiently on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize within 3 seconds on modern browsers
2. WHEN a user interacts with the timeline THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms for drag operations
3. WHEN the preview renders THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 24fps playback for standard video content
4. WHEN the application runs on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface layout appropriately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to export my finished videos, so that I can share them on various platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates video export THEN the system SHALL provide format and quality options
2. WHEN export is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and estimated completion time
3. WHEN export completes THEN the system SHALL provide download link and export summary
4. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggest resolution steps
