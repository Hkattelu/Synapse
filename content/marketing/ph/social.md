## LinkedIn (long)

Weâ€™re live on Product Hunt! Synapse Studio is a code-first video editor with a studio-grade timeline.

Why it matters:

- Faster production for product videos and changelogs
- Reusable, type-safe sequences
- Preview instantly, export locally (web export via FFmpeg WASM next)

Weâ€™d be grateful for your feedback and support on launch day.

## Makerâ€™s behind-the-scenes thread (X)

We built a real timeline for Remotion projects.
1/ Component-driven motion is powerful, but collaboration needed a visual timeline.
2/ Synapse adds keyframes, tracks, and markers â€” without leaving your stack.
3/ Local preview today; WASM export next.
