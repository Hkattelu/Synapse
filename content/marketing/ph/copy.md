## Long description (PH description field)

Synapse Studio is a code-first video editor with a real timeline. Build motion graphics and product videos from components, keyframes, and reusable sequences. Preview instantly, collaborate like code, and export high-quality video. Built on Remotion. Web export via FFmpeg WASM is coming soon.

What you can do today:

- Compose videos from React components
- Animate with keyframes, tracks, markers, and presets
- Manage assets and projects like code
- Preview instantly in the browser
- Export locally (cloudless), with web-based export coming soon

Why it‚Äôs different:

- Studio-grade timeline purpose-built for code-driven motion
- Type-safe primitives; reuse sequences across projects
- Team-ready workflows (projects, assets, versioned presets)

## Value props (bullets)

- Timeline you‚Äôll actually use: keyframes, tracks, markers
- Built for devs: type-safe components and sequences
- Speed of code, clarity of a studio UI
- Local-first today; web export via FFmpeg WASM upcoming
- Versioned presets for consistent brand motion

## Maker‚Äôs story (first-person)

We love Remotion and the power it gives developers, but we missed a proper timeline that made collaboration with non-devs easier. So we built Synapse: a studio UI that speaks code natively. The goal is simple ‚Äî ship product videos fast with the quality you expect from motion tools, while keeping the ergonomics of your stack.

## Product Hunt ‚Äúfirst comment‚Äù draft

Hey Product Hunt! üëã

We built Synapse Studio because making great product videos from code still felt harder than it should. Synapse gives you a studio-grade timeline (keyframes, tracks, markers) on top of Remotion‚Äôs component model. It‚Äôs the best of both worlds: code where it matters, a clear UI where you need it.

What‚Äôs live today:

- Compose videos with React components and presets
- Real timeline for editing and review
- Local preview + export

What‚Äôs next:

- Web export via FFmpeg WASM
- Team spaces and review links

If you‚Äôre a developer, indie maker, or a team shipping regular product clips, we‚Äôd love your feedback. We‚Äôll be around all day answering questions. Thanks for checking us out!

## FAQ

Q: Can I render entirely in the browser?
A: Preview is live in the browser. Full export is local today; web-based export via FFmpeg WASM is in active development.

Q: Do I need to know motion design?
A: Not necessarily. Start with presets and sequences. The timeline UI makes it approachable for non-motion folks, too.

Q: How does this compare to After Effects?
A: Synapse is code-first and built for product teams. It‚Äôs great for repeatable, brand-consistent videos, changelogs, and social clips. If you need deep VFX, AE still shines.

Q: Is there a free tier?
A: Yes ‚Äî see pricing below.

Q: Does it work with existing Remotion projects?
A: Yes. You can import components/sequences and manage them in Synapse‚Äôs timeline.
